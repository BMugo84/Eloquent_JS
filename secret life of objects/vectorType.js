// Look back to the Rabbit class example if youâ€™re unsure how class declarations
// look.
// Adding a getter property to the constructor can be done by putting the
// word get before the method name.
// To compute the distance from (0, 0) to
// (x, y), you can use the Pythagorean theorem, which says that the square of
// the distance we are looking for is equal to the square of the x-coordinate plus
// the square of the y-coordinate.
// Thus, (x.sqrd + y.sqrd)sqrt is the number you want, and
// Math.sqrt is the way you compute a square root in JavaScript.
